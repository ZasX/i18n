# i18n

This repository contains my solutions to the [i18n Puzzles](https://i18n-puzzles.com/). These puzzles are designed to teach about internationalization and localization concepts in programming.

## About the Puzzles

The i18n Puzzles challenge you to solve a series of programming problems that highlight common issues encountered when working with different languages, character encodings, and cultural conventions. Each day presents a new puzzle building on previous knowledge.

## Repository Structure

*   **`bin/`**: Contains a small script to create the files for a new day.
*   **`inputs/`**: Holds the input data files provided for each puzzle.
*   **`utils/`**:  Contains helper functions and utility modules used for all puzzles.
*   **`01.py`, `02.py`, ... , `20.py`**: Python scripts containing my solutions to the puzzles, named according to the puzzle number.

## Technologies Used

*   Python 3

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific solution:

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the desired puzzle script (e.g., `01.py`).
3.  Execute the script using `python 01.py`.
